# Pricing Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing product pricing to maximize revenue using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data and applying various regression models, we aim to identify the optimal price point for a product. 

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- `models/`: Saved models and performance metrics.
- `results/`: Visualizations and reports generated from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetched real-world data from an online source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned data and handled missing values.
   - Conducted feature engineering to create new informative features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated statistical summaries.
- Visualized data using pair plots and heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained multiple models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Model Comparison and Selection
- Compared model performances and selected the best model based on R-squared score.
- Visualized model predictions against actual values.

## Pricing Optimization
- Simulated different pricing strategies to determine the optimal price that maximizes revenue.
- Visualized the optimal pricing strategy.

## Results
- Identified the optimal price point to maximize revenue.
- Improved the pricing strategy leading to significant improvements in profit margins.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
