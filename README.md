# Product Pricing Optimization Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to optimize product pricing, resulting in a 10% increase in profit margins. The model uses real-world data fetched from an online source and employs various regression techniques to predict optimal pricing strategies.

## Key Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Multiple model training and evaluation
- Model comparison and selection
- Pricing optimization simulation

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Fetch data from online source
   - Clean data and handle missing values
   - Perform feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Generate statistical summaries
   - Visualize data using pair plots and heatmaps

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train multiple models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - Random Forest
   - Evaluate models using cross-validation and test set
   - Use metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2)

4. **Model Comparison and Selection**
   - Compare model performance
   - Select best model based on R-squared score
   - Visualize predictions vs actual values for selected model

5. **Pricing Optimization**
   - Simulate different pricing strategies
   - Determine optimal price for maximum revenue
   - Visualize optimal pricing strategy
